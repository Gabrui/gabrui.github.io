Circle detection algorithms applied on images are used in different contexts and areas, such as bacteria identification in Medicine and ball identification in a humanoid robot soccer competition. Specialization and
processing time are critical issues in existing algorithms and implementations so that good detection results
to different situations usually impact the execution time. Aiming to deal with trade-off of specialization and
performance, this paper proposes a parallel algorithm for circle detection using Hough Transform and MapReduce paradigm. We also compared its performance relative to its serial implementation and the one provided
by the OpenCV library. The proposed approach is useful for maintaining an accessible time execution while
increasing resultsâ€™ quality, moreover it is general in terms of usability, which aid the identification of circles
for different circumstances and inconstant environment.
