The inner alignment problem, which asserts whether an arbitrary artificial intelligence (AI) model satisfices a non-trivial
alignment function of its outputs given its inputs, is undecidable. This is rigorously proved by Rice’s theorem, which is also
equivalent to a reduction to Turing’s Halting Problem, whose proof sketch is presented in this work. Nevertheless, there is an
enumerable set of provenly aligned AIs that are constructed from a finite set of provenly aligned operations. Therefore, we
argue that the alignment should be a guaranteed property from the AI architecture rather than a characteristic imposed post-hoc
on an arbitrary AI model. Furthermore, while the outer alignment problem is the definition of a judge function that captures
human values and preferences, we propose that such a function must also impose a halting constraint that guarantees that the
AI model always reaches a terminal state in finite execution steps. Our work presents examples and models that illustrate
this constraint and the intricate challenges involved, advancing a compelling case for adopting an intrinsically hard-aligned
approach to AI systems architectures that ensures halting.
