Abstract: Hydroelectric power stations are responsible for
renewable energy generation, especially in countries with many
rivers such as Brazil. It is very important to have good estimates
of the hydrological flow in order to determine whether
thermoelectric power plants should begin operation, an event
that would increase the costs of electricity and also have a
terrible environmental impact. The monthly flow of a river was
estimated using two recurrent neural networks techniques: Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).
The results were compared with other articles that had the same
structure and used the same data: the Rio Grande river in the
Furnas and Camargos dam.
